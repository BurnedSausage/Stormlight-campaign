## Full recap

The party resumes their journey toward the warcamps on [[The Shattered Plains]], traveling alongside [[Taszo]]. During the journey, [[Taszo]] reveals that he is searching for an artifact of immense importance to his people. Their conversation is interrupted by the sound of yipping — a starving [[axehounds|axehound]] pup is found near a split [[rockbud]]. While [[Aila]] feeds the pup, prying at the rockbud releases a swarm of kremlings, forcing the party into a sudden battle.  

After the fight, the party sets up camp for the night. Around the fire, they share the reasons that brought each of them to the Shattered Plains. The night passes without incident, and the next morning they continue their travels.  

As a highstorm approaches, the group reaches [[Covenant crossroads]], a popular sheltering place where two caravans have already begun preparing: a merchant caravan and a military caravan flying the [[Kholin]] banners. The party investigates the military caravan first, noting two suspicious wagons — one chained shut and one barred. [[Aila]] overhears guards speaking of a recent bandit raid, and she spies a large chest secured inside the chained wagon. Meanwhile, [[Degal Lamar]] tends to the wounded soldiers. When [[Taszo]] approaches the barred wagon, awe spren gather around him as he gazes upon its prisoner — a man claiming to be a herald, held on [[Dalinar]]’s orders.  

The party then approaches the merchant caravan, where they meet [[Svalka]], who asks if they have seen a missing wagon that should have arrived earlier. [[Nen]] reassures everyone that there is no cause for alarm and offers the party shelter inside his storm wagon. Later, [[Taszo]] takes the group aside and confides that he believes the prisoner to be [[Talenel]], the herald of war, and that the chained chest likely contains his honorblade — the very artifact [[Taszo]] has been seeking. He explains that the honorblade would grant the powers of the [[Stonewardens]], and that he wishes to return it to [[Shinovar]] to prevent another desolation.  

Before they can act, commotion erupts as a stranded wagon struggles to reach shelter. With the highstorm moments away, the party rushes to help: [[Merikal]] and [[Roka]] drag the merchant to safety, [[Degal Lamar]] and [[Shulla]] cut the chull free from the wagon, and [[Aila]] ties down the cart. Just as they return to the crossroads, a bandit force of sixteen descends on the encampment. Four block the party’s path, and a fierce battle ensues. The party kills three of the attackers, but one escapes.  

The party kills 3 bandits and one gets away. As they return to the encampment they group overhears that the honorblade has been stolen. [[Taszo]] immediately runs after the fleeing bandits. [[Roka]] and [[Merikal]] follow shortly after. The remainder of the party stays behind to help the caravans weather the storm.

In the aftermath, they learn the honorblade has been stolen. [[Taszo]], desperate, runs after the fleeing bandits, with [[Roka]] and [[Merikal]] close behind. The rest of the group remains to aid the caravans as the stormwall crashes down. Amid the roar and fury of the storm, [[Roka]] is guided by a strange moving stone toward where [[Taszo]] had been last seen. There they find him stabbed, pain spren clustering around his body. Standing over him are three figures: a tall [[Iri|Iriali]] man wielding a shardblade untouched by the storm, an [[Alethkar|Alethi]] man with a green glyph across his face, and [[Kayan]]. The Iriali man and [[Kayan]] flee into the storm, leaving the Alethi man behind to kill the party. A brutal fight ends with [[Merikal]] striking him down.  

With his dying breath, [[Taszo]] tells the party the following:
“I saw it. The Honorblade. The assassins are led by a 
golden-skinned man. He… they were too powerful—the 
storm meant nothing to them.” He coughs, and blood 
flecks his lips before he continues. “The Blade was 
my mission. Please, you must finish it. You must unite 
Taln’s Honorblade with the others in [[Shinovar]]. Go to 
the warcamps. My Stone Shaman brothers have hired 
a powerful ally. Her name is [[Liss]]. Find her, she will know 
what to do.”
Taszo pushes himself up, then falls back against the 
ground, his breath rattling in his ribs. He forces the next 
words out. “The [[Shamanate]] will reward you, this I swear. 
You are stonewalkers, but you may be all that stands 
between this world and the next Desolation.”

“Swear on this stone.” His clenched fist opens to reveal 
a rock. With his remaining strength, he pushes it 
toward you.

The words leave you, echoing on the cliff. A woman’s 
heartbroken voice whispers like gravel, seemingly 
spoken from the very cliff itself, “This oath… you will… 
not… break!”

“You, my beautiful friends—how lucky I am to have 
found you.” He pulls at his collar, ensuring his face is 
clear, pointed to the sky. “I do not hide my face from 
the gods. I do not die in shame. My quest is given—and 
I die among friends.” He smiles as his eyes close, and his 
body slackens.

Meanwhile, [[Aila]] attempts to unlock the chained wagon’s chest but is thwarted by its fabrial mechanism. After the storm, the party arranges a funeral for [[Taszo]]. For their bravery saving the merchant, they are awarded fifty marks and a weapon of their choice. [[Merikal]] also informs [[Bordin]] of the earlier raid. Bordin sends help to the caravan. The party also shares their worry that the honorblade might have been stolen and together they check the chest, discovering a shardblade shaped like a cleaver still within. Whether it is the honorblade remains uncertain. The bandits are later confirmed to have been marked with the glyph *Pralla*.  

Three days of uneventful travel follow, and at last, the party reaches the [[The Shattered Plains]], stronger from their experiences. Each member levels up.  

## Summary  
The party continues toward the warcamps on [[The Shattered Plains]] with [[Taszo]], who reveals he is searching for an honorblade. On the road they fight a swarm of kremlings and later arrive at [[Covenant crossroads]] to take shelter from a highstorm. There they discover a [[Kholin]] caravan carrying a mysterious prisoner claiming to be a herald and a chained wagon with a secured chest.  

Before the storm hits, the party helps rescue a stranded merchant wagon, only to face a bandit attack. In the chaos, the honorblade is stolen. [[Taszo]] pursues the thieves but is mortally wounded by an [[Iri|Iriali]] shardbearer, an [[Alethkar|Alethi]] bandit with a green glyph, and [[Kayan]]. Before dying, [[Taszo]] charges the party to unite the blades, seek [[Liss]] in the warcamps, and swears them to the stone.  

After honoring [[Taszo]] with a funeral and receiving rewards for aiding the merchants, the party learns the bandits were marked with the glyph *Pralla*. With the storm behind them, they continue their journey and at last reach the [[The Shattered Plains]], stronger from their ordeals.
