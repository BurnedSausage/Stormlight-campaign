## Summary  

We begin the session at [[Degal Lamar]]’s cousin’s bedside. Her life hangs in the balance, and we must find the reaper’s tongue to save her.

With urgency, we leave and head to [[Ellar]] to begin our assigned mission. He instructs us to follow the tracks into the chasms and deal with whatever is causing trouble there.

As we enter the chasms, the air grows thick and wet. Cremlings scuttle around us, and debris from past highstorms litters the ground. Making our way through a narrow gorge, we come upon a grim sight: a pile of shattered bodies—Parshendi and Alethi alike—likely washed into this crevice by the storms. Among the corpses, four Parshendi soldiers search for something, one of them clearly standing out: a female warrior.

We attack.

In the midst of battle, no one notices that [[Aila]] begins to glow. The fight ends with the female Parshendi knocked unconscious, two others dead, and one fleeing into the chasms. The captive refuses to speak.

We search the bodies and discover the reaper’s tongue. With our prize secured, we return to the warcamps and report to [[Ellar]]. He is disappointed that we allowed one Parshendi to escape, but he still grants us our reward—20 marks each—and informs us that [[Liss]] has been sighted near the crem-oven bakery.

[[Aila]] and [[Degal Lamar]] rush to the medics, prepare the antidote, and administer it to Degal’s cousin. She quickly begins to recover and will be fully healed in a few days. Grateful, she confides in us: she is a scribe for [[Sadeas]] and overheard that [[Talenel]] is to be sent to [[Highmarshal Amaram]]. Shortly after learning this, she was poisoned. It is clear she was never meant to hear that information.

Meanwhile, the rest of the group heads toward the bakery. On the way, they encounter a half-circle of wagons just outside the warcamp—an animal circus run by [[Ryvlk]]. Inside are exotic creatures: white spines, unusual fish, and colorful birds. [[Shulla]] notices that the “exotic” chickens are merely painted ordinary chickens and successfully blackmails Ryvlk, who promises her 50 marks for her silence. Just then, chaos breaks out as two whitespines and two axehounds escape their cages.

After a brief struggle, we manage to subdue the animals and return them safely. For our efforts, we earn 50 marks and are gifted one of the songbirds.

We continue to the bakery. [[Liss]] is already inside, unsurprised to see us. She is unimpressed at first, but when we explain we are allies of [[Taszo]] and tell her what became of him, she listens. Liss reveals she has been contracted by the [[Shinovar||Shin]] to return the honorblades to [[Shinovar]]. The honorblades, according to legend, grant the powers of the Radiants to any who wield them. She urges us to locate the honorblade we previously encountered at the [[Covenant crossroads]] and speak to its former bearer, [[Talenel]].

Suddenly, the stone carried by [[Roka]] begins to shake violently, and a small woman emerges from it—[[Po'ahu]], a stone spren. She explains that she had been bound to [[Taszo]], who would have made a great Stonewarden. Stonewardens, she says, were Radiants who must return. She hopes that being near [[Talenel]] will restore his mind.

[[Liss]] informs us that Talenel is kept in a dark cell in the monastery. We leave the bakery, only to be surrounded by five armed men who draw their swords. We defeat them swiftly.

When questioned, Liss admits she is unsure who sent them, but warns that more dangerous foes will soon be after us.

On the way to the monastery, we cross paths with [[Bettani]], who tells us that [[Dalinar]] has re-founded the Knights Radiant and appointed [[Highmarshal Amaram]] as their leader.

We infiltrate the temple and find [[Talenel]]’s cell. He sits slumped on his bed, muttering the same phrases over and over—until he sees [[Po'ahu]]. In that moment, he becomes lucid. “A peak spren… is there still hope?” he asks. We question him about his sword. He senses it but says it no longer responds to him—it lies in [[Rathalas]]. He is uncertain whether he can wield it again but insists we must retrieve it and return it to [[Shinovar]]. He does not know the whereabouts of the other honorblades.

[[Aila]] speaks the Words and becomes a Knight Radiant. “Your purpose is not to fight the desolation. Fight them—find [[Ishar]].” Talenel’s lucidity fades, and he returns to his broken recitations. We leave him in his cell.

As we make our exit, we are confronted by six spear-wielding soldiers in green uniforms. [[Amaram]] arrives. He questions our presence. We attempt to talk our way out, claiming only to seek a better fate, but he sees through our lies. “You have made an enemy today,” he warns. “The Sons of Honour are watching.” Then he leaves.

We regroup and make our plan: we will depart the [[Warcamps]] at dawn and travel to [[Rathalas]].
