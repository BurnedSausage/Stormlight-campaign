Rathalas, also known as the Rift and formerly called Rathalathar, was a city in the northern part of the Eastern Crownlands near central [[Alethkar]]. The city was burnt to the ground in 1163 and has not since been rebuilt.

The city resided within a deep chasm that narrows at one end and opens onto the Sea of Spears at the other.
