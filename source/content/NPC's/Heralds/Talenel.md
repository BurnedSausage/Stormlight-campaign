## Information
Herald of war, imprisoned in the [[Kholin]] caravan. 

Taln is unresponsive even while conscious, staring unseeing as he repeatedly utters a mantra. Taln repeats the following mantra in a deep monotone: 

“I am Talenel’Elin, Herald of War. The time of the Return, the Desolation, is near at hand. We must prepare. You will have forgotten much, following the destruction of the times past. [[Kalak]] will teach you to cast bronze, if you have forgotten this. We will Soulcast blocks of metal directly for you. I wish we could teach you steel, but casting is so much easier than forging, and you must have something we can produce quickly. Your stone tools will not serve against what is to come. [[Vedel]] can train your surgeons, and [[Jezrien]]... he will teach you leadership. So much is lost between Returns… I will train your soldiers. We should have time. [[Ishar]] keeps talking about a way to keep information from being lost following Desolations. And you have discovered something unexpected. We will use that. Surgebinders to act as guardians… Knights… The coming days will be difficult, but with training, human ity will survive. You must bring me to your leaders. The other Heralds should join us soon. I am Talenel’Elin…
