## Backstory

Merikal was born and raised within the walls of [[Kholinar]], a city of careful order and rigid hierarchy. His family has long held **Tenth Dahn**, their station modest among the light-eyed, and their trade a simple one: his father, and his father before him, were shoemakers.

For generations, his family has struggled to make ends meet, often relying on loans and favors from wealthier, higher-Dahn families. The debts are small yet persistent, a reminder of their place in the social order and a source of quiet resentment.

Driven by ambition and frustration, Merikal once attempted to steal from one such higher-Dahn family's [[Talenar]], hoping to relieve his family’s burdens. The attempt failed, however, and the [[Talenar]] has since taken pains to make his life increasingly difficult, a shadow he cannot escape within the streets of Kholinar.

Now, seeking both freedom from his adversaries and the chance to forge his own path, Merikal journeys to the **Shattered Plains**. There, away from the reach of the family that humiliated him, he hopes to prove that skill, diligence, and cunning can command respect where birth and wealth have denied it. The weight of his family’s debts sharpens his resolve, and he carries with him the quiet determination to reclaim their honor—and to ensure that the Tenth-Dahn shoemaker is remembered for more than his station.
