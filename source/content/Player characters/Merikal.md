Player: Koen <br>Origin: [[Alethkar |Alethi]], [[Iri|Iriali]]<br>Path: Leader <br>
## Appearance
Merikal is an unassuming figure: light-eyed, with green eyes and a solidly average frame. His short, black buzz cut can’t quite hide the subtle touch of Iriali heritage in his features, hinting at a lineage that is not pure Alethi.

He dresses in a ragged outfit that has seen better days—clothes that may once have passed for finery but now speak only of long use. His boots, however, are meticulously kept, the one piece of his appearance that suggests pride or practicality amid his otherwise worn look.

## Backstory

Merikal was born and raised within the walls of [[Kholinar]], a city of careful order and rigid hierarchy. His family has long held **Tenth Dahn**, their station modest among the light-eyed, and their trade a simple one: his father, and his father before him, were shoemakers.

For generations, his family has struggled to make ends meet, often relying on loans and favors from wealthier, higher-Dahn families. The debts are small yet persistent, a reminder of their place in the social order and a source of quiet resentment.

For  a chance to forge his own path, Merikal now journeys to the [[The Shattered Plains]]. There he hopes to prove that skill, diligence, and cunning can command respect where birth and wealth have denied it. To ensure that the Tenth-Dahn shoemaker is remembered for more than his station.
