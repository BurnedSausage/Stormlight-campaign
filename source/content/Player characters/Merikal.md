Player: Koen <br>Origin: [[Alethkar |Alethi]], [[Iri|Iriali]]<br>Path: Leader <br>
## Appearance
Merikal is an unassuming figure: light-eyed, with green eyes and a solidly average frame. His short, black buzz cut can’t quite hide the subtle touch of Iriali heritage in his features, hinting at a lineage that is not pure Alethi.

He dresses in a ragged outfit that has seen better days—clothes that may once have passed for finery but now speak only of long use. His boots, however, are meticulously kept, the one piece of his appearance that suggests pride or practicality amid his otherwise worn look.
