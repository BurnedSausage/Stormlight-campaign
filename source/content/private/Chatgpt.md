## Summary  
The party resumes their journey toward the warcamps on [[The Shattered Plains]], traveling alongside [[Taszo]]. During the journey, [[Taszo]] reveals that he is searching for an artifact of immense importance to his people. Their conversation is interrupted by the sound of yipping — a starving [[axehounds|axehound]] pup is found near a split [[rockbud]]. While [[Aila]] feeds the pup, prying at the rockbud releases a swarm of kremlings, forcing the party into a sudden battle.  

After the fight, the party sets up camp for the night. Around the fire, they share the reasons that brought each of them to the Shattered Plains. The night passes without incident, and the next morning they continue their travels.  

As a highstorm approaches, the group reaches [[Covenant crossroads]], a popular sheltering place where two caravans have already begun preparing: a merchant caravan and a military caravan flying the [[Kholin]] banners. The party investigates the military caravan first, noting two suspicious wagons — one chained shut and one barred. [[Aila]] overhears guards speaking of a recent bandit raid, and she spies a large chest secured inside the chained wagon. Meanwhile, [[Degal Lamar]] tends to the wounded soldiers. When [[Taszo]] approaches the barred wagon, awe spren gather around him as he gazes upon its prisoner — a man claiming to be a herald, held on [[Dalinar]]’s orders.  

The party then approaches the merchant caravan, where they meet [[Svalka]], who asks if they have seen a missing wagon that should have arrived earlier. [[Nen]] reassures everyone that there is no cause for alarm and offers the party shelter inside his storm wagon. Later, [[Taszo]] takes the group aside and confides that he believes the prisoner to be [[Talenel]], the herald of war, and that the chained chest likely contains his honorblade — the very artifact [[Taszo]] has been seeking. He explains that the honorblade would grant the powers of the [[Stonewardens]], and that he wishes to return it to [[Shinovar]] to prevent another desolation.  

Before they can act, commotion erupts as a stranded wagon struggles to reach shelter. With the highstorm moments away, the party rushes to help: [[Merikal]] and [[Roka]] drag the merchant to safety, [[Degal Lamar]] and [[Shulla]] free the chull from its harness, and [[Aila]] ties down the cart. Just as they return to the crossroads, a bandit force of sixteen descends on the encampment. Four block the party’s path, and a fierce battle ensues. The party kills three of the attackers, but one escapes.  

In the aftermath, they learn the honorblade has been stolen. [[Taszo]], desperate, runs after the fleeing bandits, with [[Roka]] and [[Merikal]] close behind. The rest of the group remains to aid the caravans as the stormwall crashes down. Amid the roar and fury of the storm, [[Roka]] is guided by a strange floating stone toward where [[Taszo]] has fallen. There they find him stabbed, pain spren clustering around his body. Standing over him are three figures: a tall [[Iri|Iriali]] man wielding a shardblade untouched by the storm, an [[Alethkar|Alethi]] man with a green glyph across his face, and [[Kayan]]. The Iriali man and [[Kayan]] flee into the storm, leaving the Alethi man behind to kill the party. A brutal fight ends with [[Merikal]] striking him down.  

With his dying breath, [[Taszo]] tells the party he saw the honorblade — a weapon unaffected by the storm — and warns that to prevent the desolation, the blades must be united. He urges them to seek [[Liss]] in the warcamps, promising she is a powerful ally, and swears them to the stone. [[Roka]] takes up the small, living stone that had guided him, and a gravelly voice confirms the oath has been accepted. [[Taszo]] then dies.  

Meanwhile, [[Aila]] attempts to unlock the chained wagon’s chest but is thwarted by its fabrial mechanism. After the storm, the party arranges a funeral for [[Taszo]]. For their bravery, they are awarded fifty marks and a weapon of their choice. [[Merikal]] also informs [[Bordin]] of the earlier raid, and together they check the chest, discovering a shardblade shaped like a cleaver still within. Whether it is the honorblade remains uncertain. The bandits are later confirmed to have been marked with the glyph *Pralla*.  

Three days of uneventful travel follow, and at last, the party reaches the [[The Shattered Plains]], stronger from their experiences. Each member levels up.
